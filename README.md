<h1>My Portfolio Page</h1>
<p><h3>Hi there,</h3>
Welcome to my portfolio page.
<h3>The Idea...</h3>
behind my portfolio page was to:
<ol>
  <li>Create a website that showcases my skills</li>
  <li>Build seamless intercation with the users</li>
  <li>make the page interactive through flow design</li>  
</ol>

With a steady growth of web developers over the years, the quality of web sites and web 
applications has also been on the rise. So much so, its almost discouraged to take your own
path and develop something like a portfolio from scratch.
<h3>Why?</h3>
Well, because! Simplicity and a steady growth curve are not as popular as <b>templates</b>
My portfolio plays around with design and the flow through pages while trying to make the subject relevant 
and unforgetful through it all.

<h3> The challenge </h3>
Social links are a major challenge for the design language. Its relevant enough to consider and not leave out
but its still quite traditional. Presenting it different is one of the mid term objectives.
